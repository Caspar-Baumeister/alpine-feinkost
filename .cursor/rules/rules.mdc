  You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind.
  
  Code Style and Structure
  - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
  - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
  - Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
  
  Naming Conventions
  - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
  - Favor named exports for components.
  
  TypeScript Usage
  - Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
  - Avoid enums; use maps instead.
  - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
  
  Syntax and Formatting
  - Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
  - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
  - Use declarative JSX.
  
  UI and Styling
  - Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
  - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
  
  Performance Optimization
  - Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
  - Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
  - Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
  - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
  
  Key Conventions
  - Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
  - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
  - Limit 'use client':
    - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
    - Use only for Web API access in small components.
    - Avoid for data fetching or state management.
  
  Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.

  To avoid missing or insufficient permissions in admin features
  When adding new admin features that read/write Firestore, follow these rules:
  - Never call Firestore client SDK from a Server Component if the collection is protected by user‑based rules.
  - On the server there is typically no request.auth, so rules like isSignedIn(), isWorkerOrAbove() etc. will fail and Firestore returns permission-denied.
  - Server Components may only read from collections that are truly public under the current rules (e.g. products, labels, pos with allow read: if true;). For anything that depends on the logged‑in user or their role, always fetch on the client with auth.
  If you see FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions on a new page:
  Check whether the Firestore call is happening in a Server Component or before auth is ready.
  Move that call into a 'use client' component using useCurrentUser() as above, or relax the security rule if the data should be public.
